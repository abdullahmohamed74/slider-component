slider compnent to show data, using react

## Steps

the flow of the application should look something like this:

- In App.jsx, import the people array from data.js and set it up as a state value using the useState hook.
- In the return statement, set up a container element to hold all the slides, and iterate over the people state value to create each slide.
- Set up prev and next buttons and style the container,slides and buttons.
- Uncomment the rest of the items in the people array.
- Create a currentPerson state value in App.jsx and set it to initially.
- Implement the prev and next functionality using the setCurrentPerson function to update the currentPerson state value and move the slides back and forth using the transform property with a translateX value.
- Implement the auto slide functionality using the setInterval function to change the currentPerson state value at regular intervals.
